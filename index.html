<h1><i>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine</i></h1>
<u>It's the Ten Duel Commandments</u>
<hr>
<h1><b>Number one</b></h1>
<hr>
<u>The challenge, <s>demand</s> satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action</u>
<hr>
<h1><b>Number two</b></h1>
<hr>
<s>If they don't, grab a friend</s>, that's your second
<u>Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned</u>
<hr>
<h1><b>Number three</b></h1>
<hr>
<u>Have your seconds meet face to face</u>
<s>Negotiate a peace</s>
Or negotiate a time and place
This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits
<s>Most disputes die, and no one shoots</s>
<hr>
<h1><b>Number four</b></h1>
<hr>
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility
You have him turn around so he can have deniability
<hr>
<h1><b>Five</b></h1>
<hr>
Duel before the sun is in the sky
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
<hr>
<b>Number six</b>
<hr>
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell 'em where you been
Pray that hell or heaven lets you in
<hr>
<h1><b>Seven</b></h1>
<hr>
Confess your sins
Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent
<hr>
<h1><b>Number eight</b></h1>
<hr>
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight
Alexander
Aaron Burr, sir
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?
Okay, so we're doin' this
<hr>
<h2><b>Number nine</b></h2>
<hr>
<i>Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher</i>
<i>Summon all the courage you require</i>
Then count
<b>One two three four
Five six seven eight nine
Number
Ten paces
Fire</b>
